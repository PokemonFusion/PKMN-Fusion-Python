This is to make someone's life easier.

There may be some missing instructions here that I forgot to write down, but this should at least help you get started.

You will find the data for converting using the Pokemon Showdown source code.  If you can't find that via google, then
good luck.  Read all before you begin so you don't waste time.

In order to convert the JS dictionaries into something python can understand,
you will need to convert them into json objects.  The main complication with this is the "function" parts within the
javascript objects.  You will need to comment them out into strings using ` on both sides.  Visual Studio Code will
be helpful with finding anything that is broken. You will want to do a replace for any ': function' with ': `function'
and then find all of the matching closing brackets.  Some are easy and paired with a ; before, but some aren't and will
be difficult to build a regix to auto fix.  You may need to convert the spacing to tabs for this to work.

regix replace:

Find
Replace

: function
: `function

;\n\t\t},
;\n\t\t}`,

;\n\t\t\t},
;\n\t\t\t}`,

;\n\t\t\t\t},
;\n\t\t\t\t}`,

}\n\t\t},
}\n\t\t}`,

}\n\t\t\t},
}\n\t\t\t}`,

}\n\t\t\t\t},
}\n\t\t\t\t}`,


Anything else will need to be manually found.

At time of conversion, I used this site, if it doesn't exist you will need to find another site.

If the files are in TS format instead of JS, which is likely new, you will need to convert to JS first.
